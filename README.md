# Ozark Client
literal sex

If you wanna build the src, here's a quick run of the
mill explanation on how to build (altough idk why you would)

# building the sex ðŸ˜Ž

1. go into command prompt

2. do cd (directory) until you get to the directory where the file is and then do cd (file name)

3. do gradlew build, after that it should build

4. Go into the file, look for build > libs > then you should see two .jar files, the one the says
releases should be the usable file!

if it doesnt work then fuck ^_^ pointless readme change
