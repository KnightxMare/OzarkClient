# Ozark Client
literal sex

# building the sex ðŸ˜Ž
1. Extract the folder to a location

2. go into command prompt

3. do cd (directory) until you get to the directory where the file is and then do cd (file name)

4. do gradlew build, after that it should build

5. Go into the file, look for build > libs > then you should see three .jar files, the one that has -all in end of it
is the jar file you should use.

u also need a JDK (we recommend JDK 1.8), a free one is adopt open jdk https://adoptopenjdk.net/

for offhand use crystal mode and gapple in hole if u want, health is based on preference

default burrow delay is fine, but you can change it if it doesnt work for u that good

elytrafly set the speed to 1.8 - 2.0, go higher if the server anticheat allows it, if it lags back with normal speed, set glide speed higher, superior mode is the best mode btw, elytrafly isn't compatible with nofall, thats why ozark elytrafly auto toggles ozark nofall, so make sure that no other clients have the nofall module toggled when you're using elytra fly.

# capes
even tho client is leaked dm if u want to have cape

I'll also be making more capes!
