blah blah ozarkclient got leaked so fart.

heres the original read me for ozark client

# Ozark Client
literal sex

# building the sex ðŸ˜Ž
1. Extract the folder to a location

2. go into command prompt

3. do cd (directory) of the shit

4. do gradlew build, after that it should build

5. Go into the file, look for build > libs > then you should see three .jar files, the one that has -all in end of it
is the jar file you should use

6. Accept ozark owns you

u also need a JDK (we recommend JDK 1.8), a free one is adopt open jdk https://adoptopenjdk.net/

use predict, as well as ares mode, but it may drop frames. faceplace mode is decent try it out. 

for offhand use crystal mode and gapple in hole if u want, health is based on preference but 18-20 is probably the best

default burrow delay is fine, but you can change it if it doesnt work for u that good

elytrafly set the speed to 1.8 - 2.0, go higher if the server anticheat allows it, if it lags back with normal speed, set glide speed higher, superior mode is the best mode btw, elytrafly isn't compatible with nofall, thats why ozark elytrafly auto toggles ozark nofall, so make sure that no other clients have the nofall module toggled when you're using elytra fly. the timer module in elytrafly is good for taking off easier

for surround, set toggle, rotate, and all the other stuff off, and set swing to NONE, and mode normal

turn off smart mode in auto armor, and turn off tps sync on kill aura UNLESS in low tps. 

if you wanna use the cool past gui instead of the bad default bope/wp2 gui, remove the bind for the normal gui module, and set the bind in the past gui module.
